# beatstrip
Notice: This project has been created with serial communication in mind. The raspberry pi 5 has to be connected via serial connection to any arduino board. As soon as neopixel updates the strip drivers to support the Pi5's new GPIO interface, I'll integrate the direct strip control to the Pi itself.
